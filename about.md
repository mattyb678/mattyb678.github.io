# Hey, I'm MattyB

My real name is Matt Berteaux, but everyone calls me MattyB.

I'm a programmer, living in Utah. I love learning new languages, frameworks, and paradigms. I'm a full-stack developer, but I do sometimes list a little towards the backend.

In the last two years, I have also picked up the running bug...hard.

<div class="img_wrapper">
  ![Me Running]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/me.png)
</div>

This blog will be a mix of programmy and runny thoughts mostly.

My goal is to force myself to be accountable to do cool things.
